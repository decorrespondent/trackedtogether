	description: 'Everybody is encouraged to download an app that uses bluetooth to track what other phones are in close proximity. These phones emit an ephemeral token which is stored on the receiving phone. Once somebody is diagnosed with COVID-19 a signal is being send to all phones with the ephemeral codes. If your phone is carrying this code, you will get a warning that you have been in close proximity with somebody recently that has been tested positive. Then you can get tested yourself or go into quarantine. The goal is to stop outbreaks early on and to help the health officials find infected people sooner. The app only works when 60 percent of the population uses it.',
