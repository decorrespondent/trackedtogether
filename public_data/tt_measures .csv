The software takes two weeks of mobile-phone tracking information from the infected person then matches with location data collected by national mobile phone companies that pinpoints citizens who were in the patient’s vicinity for more than 15 minutes and are vulnerable to contagion.

Fleming features an advanced mapping tool that identifies the spread of the virus in real time, empowering health and government decision-makers. By utilising the Fleming system, these decision-makers can more effectively deploy resources, including critical supplies and medical personnel, and implement public health protocols that help contain the spread. In addition, Fleming is helping officials in developing strategies to reopen economies in regions where the pandemic no longer poses a serious health threat. The technology anonymises all data inputted by the operator, which adds an additional layer of privacy and security. Fleming is already being operated by countries around the world as health officials work to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep citizens safe and healthy.

How long has it been in deployment and where?
Immediately upon the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, NSO – which specialises in developing life-saving technology solutions – recruited the best minds internally, alongside epidemiologists and other experts.
