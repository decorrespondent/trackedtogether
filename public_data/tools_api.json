    "description": "Around 12 countries are testing NSO technology which \"analyzes data\" to map people’s movements to identify who they’ve come in contact with. The software takes two weeks of mobile-phone tracking information from the infected person then matches with location data collected by national mobile phone companies that pinpoints citizens who were in the patient’s vicinity for more than 15 minutes and are vulnerable to contagion.\n\nFleming features an advanced mapping tool that identifies the spread of the virus in real time, empowering health and government decision-makers. By utilising the Fleming system, these decision-makers can more effectively deploy resources, including critical supplies and medical personnel, and implement public health protocols that help contain the spread. In addition, Fleming is helping officials in developing strategies to reopen economies in regions where the pandemic no longer poses a serious health threat. The technology anonymises all data inputted by the operator, which adds an additional layer of privacy and security. Fleming is already being operated by countries around the world as health officials work to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep citizens safe and healthy.\n\nHow long has it been in deployment and where?\nImmediately upon the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, NSO – which specialises in developing life-saving technology solutions – recruited the best minds internally, alongside epidemiologists and other experts. NSO was able to quickly develop an innovative system to help eradicate the spread of the pandemic. Fleming was developed in Israel, NSO’s main development centre.",

The idea was to let Iranians determine if they had severe symptoms, in order to prevent citizens from needlessly flooding local hospitals.\n\nAccording to ZDNet: A Google spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons the app was removed; however, sources familiar with Play Store policies told ZDNet the app was most likely taken down because of its misleading claims -- namely that it could detect COVID-19 infections, something that is impossible through an app.",

It is not clear from reports what ‘health status’ would include, nor was it clear what biometric information would be used — though in Russia this information could refer to height, weight, hair color, fingerprints, DNA analysis, retina images, facial recognition (photos and videos), and voice samples. Furthermore, the app would apparently note the person’s “social trustworthiness” rating. What a “social trustworthiness” rating is, what indicators are used to assign it or what it might be used for can only be speculated about at present, but it was suggested that refusal to install the app would result in a lowered rating.”",

By briefly using the device’s microphone and measuring the time sound takes to travel, ultrasound can accurately measure the distance between devices. The benefit of this combined method is avoiding false positives that would be generated from Bluetooth alone, such as contacts that may be on the other side of a wall – nearby, but not creating a risk of exposure.”",

In this video, we show how Palantir software has helped the regions monitor the pandemic and measure their response efforts.Palantir powers a Covid-19 Common Operating Picture (COP) that integrates publicly accessible data from a range of sources, including demographic and economic information, traffic and mobility data, and Covid-19 data. This overview of the pandemic helps authorized team members support crisis response. For example, safety region directors and information managers are able to:\nMonitor the geographic distribution of Covid-19 cases in real time.\nExplore public mobility data to understand how response measures impact people’s movement.\nAnalyze unexpected risk vectors, such as road works or weather that might cause crowding.\nShare discoveries and reports across regions.\n",
