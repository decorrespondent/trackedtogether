# Track(ed) Together

This repository contains code and data from the Track(ed) Together Project. This project from the Dutch online magazine De Correspondent ran between May 1st 2020 and May 1st 2021. The purpose was to establish an overview of surveillance measures taken to combat the covid-19 pandemic and to get insights into the scope, use and effectiveness of those measures. The project was meant to last for a year on the assumption that the crisis would be over by then. That wasn't the case. 

It would be great if other people and organization could built on our dataset. Therefore we share our data and code with you. Feel free to use the data and code as you see fit, but it would be nice if you can attribute the data collection to us. All data have been frequently updated and verified. Data sources are provided as well. 

If you want to get a sense of the type of stories or research you can do with this data, please take a look at some of our [stories at The Correspondent](https://thecorrespondent.com/collection/track-ed-together) or, in Dutch, at [De Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/collectie/track-ed-together). 

## About the data


In the root you'll find two files:
* **mongo_schema**: this file contains the MongoDB shell command that creates the validation JSON schema for the surveillance collection.
* **sample_insert**: this file contains an example of a MongoDB shell command that creates one document in the surveillance collection.

There's also a `_dumps` directory which contains three folders:
* **mongo**: this folder contains a dump of the db that can be imported with the `mongorestore` command.
* **private**: this folder contains raw csv dumps of the surveillance collection with all fields..
* **mongo**: this folder contains csv dumps of the surveillance collection with some fields and object fields split up over multiple columns. 

To create dumps use these commands:

**mongo**

`mongodump --db=surveillance --collection=measures --out=_dumps/mongo`

**private**

`mongoexport --db=surveillance --collection=measures --type=csv  --fieldFile=_dumps/_private_fields.txt --out=_dumps/private/$(date +%s).csv`

**public**

`mongoexport --db=surveillance --collection=measures --type=csv  --fieldFile=_dumps/_public_fields.txt --out=_dumps/public/$(date +%s).csv`
